- Completed new UI style design and building action.
- Update build instruction and explore options to build a full automated box
<hr>
## 3. Accomplishments/next sprint goals<br>
- Continue add more function into web application, such as user profiles and multi-tag supports
- Add Admin roles to manage the whole website.
<hr>
## 4. Bug tracking<br>
- Continue modify mongodb DeprecationWarning.
- CSS is not being picked up in our newly added pages.
<hr>
## 5. Security Assumptions<br>
On our last sprint, we didn’t utilize the .gitignore file and posted our RSA keys, SSL keys and vagrant related file to our GitHub repo, which is a serious security threat. We solved that by creating a .gitignore file and add all these security-related files in it so it won’t get pushed to our repository. The SSL keys are now self-generated by our post-installation script for packer.

## 6. Team members comment<br>
Each team members' comments on their accomplishments
- Akshay: As a backup i helped out with other tasks along with mine. Continuing to maintain and run the environment of the website. Search a against image website & design visual detail site-maps for both existed project web and against image website. Also taking the project managers input and working on small tasks like fixing bug and searching for minor errors. <br>
- Hugo: As Lead developer again the main goal after the purge of the cloudinary api was getting back functionality of things like searching for multiple pictures with tags which was done by splitting input from the tagline on a space, inserting them into the search array and then locating the picture among all the pictures tagged located on mongo DB. It was also to add more sleek functionality like making it so the 3 radio buttons only showed once “Get Started” was selected. <br>
- Jingwen: My role in IT operations is to maintain the environment and make sure is running. I need to make sure that the application is working with different development environments.
- Tom: As the project manager in this sprint, my duty is to manage everything of the team such as  make a direction and sign the task. During the sprint, I have coordinating cooperation between team-members and make a good teamwork environment for all of the team member enjoy working on. For the direction of our production, I pick a target competitor website: instagram.com. From make a comparison between our present web application and competitor, I found the disadvantage of our website and assign all of the disadvantage as the fix goal for next sprint. <br>
- Maryam: As a Jr. Developer for this sprint, I helped the team with our developing environment. As assigned by the project manager, I along with the lead developer helped accomplished in figuring out if we could store our images in MongoDB and then fletch them. We also continued working on modifying our search and edit functions for our images. <br>
- Wenzhao: As a UI / UX developer for this sprint, I was responsible for continuing refining and working on a responsive design view for our website. I invited a few of my classmates from different majors to test out our live demo and make adjustments based on their feedback. I also continued to work on the automated script for our testing environment since the last version of our script involves the use of provision script in vagrant. By utilizing PM2, our web app is now running automatically in the background when the system boots up. <br>

## 7. Referenced material<br>

Data function build :
- https://github.com/aheckmann/gridfs-stream
- https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/in/?fbclid=IwAR2lLmGhybs77WMN20C_KSAqYdJICNMevqTdmbQ8bsnevecqlac0cR605DM

<hr>


o	Use case 1: Upon a complete build from scratch, register for your site successfully as a user
o	Use case 2:  Login as that newly created user and execute an essential operation to your site.  (For instance, if it is a blog, post a blog entry, upload and tag an image, or place a recommendation – this will demonstrate the purpose of your work and purpose of your application).  Do this twice.
Project Base Requirements

Each Project will have additional specific details per job to be delivered once project subject is determined and require you to explain your implementation and decisions in these categories: Each element here where applicable needs a git commit SHA and URL and or a Trello card

1.	Language and framework of your choice (ITM 311, ITM 312, ITMD 361, ITMD 411)
- We are using the node.js as environment language and express as the framework.<br>
<hr>
2.	Operating System Platform of Choice (ITM 301, ITMO 456)
- Ubuntu Vanilla 16.04 was used because of its has a relatively small installation size and all the dependencies / packages we needed for our projects are available on it.
- We are using a list of npm packages for our projects, includes: express, gridfs-stream, multer, passport-local
<hr>
3.	Use of Data Store/Storage (ITMD 421, ITMD 411, ITMO 456)
- We are using MongoDB for data storage, and Gridfs in cooperated to store images to our MongoDB, it divides our image files into small chunks of data and stored within the MongoDB collections.
<hr>
4.	Data encrypted at rest (ITMS 448)<br>
- All our user password are hashed and stored in our MongoDB user schema
- ![Screenshot](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2019-team-08f/blob/master/diagrams/sprint-report-screenshots/hash.JPG)
<hr>
5.	Database makes use of master/slave replication (~ITMD 421, ITMD 411)<br>
- Schema creation: User Schema for user, and mongodb automatic generated metadata table for image(upload.files shcema and upload.chunks schema), all the comments are stored in the comment schema.
- ![Screenshot](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2019-team-08f/blob/master/diagrams/sprint-report-screenshots/schemas.JPG)
- Master for database writes: MongoDB primary dataset will be used to write data. The primary dataset will perform all write operations and store user data.
- Slave for database reads: Data will be read from MongoDB replica set. The replica set will replicate what’s in the primary dataset and serves as a backup. The master slave replication has been deprecated, so we use replica set to read from primary database.
<br>
<hr>
6.	Use of Responsive design (where applicable) (ITMD 361, ITMD 362)
- We use Bootstrap and also write our own CSS to overwrite some of those (With the !important rule). Bootstrap is used to create an overall design for our website, while CSS is used to adjust small details and customization.
<br>
- ![Screenshot](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/2019-team-08f/blob/master/diagrams/sprint-report-screenshots/responsive.PNG)
<hr>

7.	Use of https (ITMS 448, ITMO 456)
- Self-signed certifications are created in part of our post-installation script and we configured a .gitignore file to ignore it.
- All ports are blocked, only port 443 and 80 are explicitly allowed in Vanilla 16.04 since it is served as a web server.
- Records can be preseed via db.collection and the collection.insertOne method.
- https://flaviocopes.com/node-mongodb/<br>
<hr>
8.	Use of user authentication (ITMD 361)
- We use passport-local module for user authentication.

- The basic features for different types of users remain the same to our previous sprint:
- As unauthenticated users, they can view images uploaded by other users and search them based on tags.
- As authenticated users, they can do all the things unauthenticated users do, additionally, they can upload their images with or without tags to our Cloudinary storage, they can also edit or delete their own pictures.
- As administrative users, they have the same permission as authenticated users, additionally, they can take down any pictures that are inappropriate, regardless of the users that upload it (copyright violation,  - sensitive contents)
- UI is modified per authenticated user via CSS<br>
<hr>
9.	Creation of Dev Environment (local laptop), (ITMO 456)
- Packer script and vagrant is used to create an Ubuntu Vanilla 16.04, referencing Professor Jeremy’s given script with modification. Our web app is deployed in our dev environment automatically at start up by utilizing pm2, a node.js process manager. It is installed and set up via the post installation script.

- We invited some of our classmates to test our website in multi-view to test its thoroughness and have them commented on our design, and we adjusted our design based on that. For example, our header in the mobile view remained the same design as it is in desktop view, the majority of our testers said it would be hard to access it, so we had redesigned it specifically for the mobile view and it goes back to normal in tablet and desktop view.

- Demonstration of bug reports being filed, tracked, fixed, and closed via Trello cards and GitHub commits
- Bugs are filed and tracked via Trello and GitHub issues
- For example, we had a bug that we weren’t be able to see the images when we are in the all pictures view, it is not picking up the path for the images due to deprecated URL. As soon as I fixed that, I moved the task for “bug” to “done”.<br>
<hr>
10.	Layout design (ITMD 361, 362, ITMM 471)
- Diagrams are located under Diagram -> UI -> UI_Diagram folder
- Sample Output

11.	Management of Visio (or comparable) diagram tool of work flow (ITM 301, ITMO 456)
- Flowchart is under the folder Diagrams / UI
<br>
<hr>
12.	Management of project progress (ITMM 471)
- a.	Trello – correlate completed goals to DONE Trello cards and unfinished goals to in progress Trello cards

# 2. Goals for this Sprint
Choose and decide initial development language, set up initial development environment, along with our site, have our database up and running. Lay a foundational platform for our future goals & sprints.

  a. For our initial goals we have accomplished everything and see our team on track for our upcoming sprint.
  
  b. For our future goals, we might have to be more productive in the first week, so we have enough time for bug testing/fixingin the later week.
 
# 3. Accomplishments/next sprint goals
  a. We were successful in accomplishing our initial set up tasks; we successfully chose and deployed our initial language  framework, we deployed an up and running site and database. We are able to successfully deploy the upload, edit & delete functions of our site. We accomplished creating the login page and homepage layouts along with the project flowchart. 
  
  b. Our next sprint goals include; successful deployement of the tagging function, moreover incorporating the rendering vs storing pre-rendered images function in our project.

# 4. Bug tracking
Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 was used as our Dev & Test environment to test our program and resolve any bug issues.

# 5. Security Assumptions
To mitigate any security risks we felt the need for securing our databases, therefore We assumped that we would need data encryption for our project. We discovered this when we initialized the use of MongoDB for our database storage and discovered that it offers native symmetric encryption support for databases. Therefore we incorportaed the use of AES-256-CBC as our decryption process.  

# 6. Team members comment

Hugo: "Established team communications and dynamics on how we work best. Personal, established scope of the project, as well as initial drafts/skeleton of website UI."

Jingwen: "I created a project flowchart using Visio to give an overview of project work flow. I also created a initial layout for the login page and home page."

Tom:"As a developer I want to create the best code for the project. Working with express node.js and JavaScript can be a little tricky but it is the best framework and language that I can work with. Continuing the project I will do more to the site."

Maryam: "I accomplished helping the team setup initial functions and roles of the team members for sprint 1, established initial development language framework; what should we use, who is familiar with what. Apart from being a Jr. Developer, I also helped the team with project management, making sure we were on track and what needed to be done in order to stay on track."

Wenzhao:"As a IT Operations I wanted to make sure that I get the correct code for layout for uploading and downloading the image. Also continuing to make sure our operations for this project work in an orderly manner."


# 7. Refrenced material
Although, we didn't use any specific material from class lectures, however we did use github for our repository storage and vagrant, as suggested by the Professor.
